This website was created with HTML. You can use your own HTML experience to edit, or download Brackets and link the GitHub desktop app to this respository. 

I used the video below to get started on working with Brackets. You can see your edits done in real time through Brackets before committing changes to the repository.
Brackets is also useful if you have no experience in HTML.
